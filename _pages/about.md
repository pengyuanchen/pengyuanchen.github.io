My name is Pengyuan Chen. I am a 3rd year student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. 
I used to work at <a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank">ICSI</a> Vision Group as a research intern. 
My academic and career interests lie in deep learning, applied mathematics & statistics, and entrepreneurship.
I am an avid runner, classical music lover and amateur photographer. Recently, I started teaching and making tutorials.
