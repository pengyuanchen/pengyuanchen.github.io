I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. I used to work at <a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank">ICSI</a> Vision Group as a research intern. My academic and career interests lie in deep learning, applied mathematics and statistics. I am also an avid runner, working towards my first marathon.
